## Hi there

This is Maxel Black, a developer who loves cross-platform frameworks. 

...but also Windows UI!

I usually develop with `Java` or `Kotlin/JVM` , sometimes write a little `HTML` and `CSS` . I hate `Python` and `PHP` , although they're simple for small tools / web development. And I'm currently a senior high student.

By the way, I've used Arch Linux for three years before. But I'm now using Windows because of its compatibility.

This repository also contains my home page. (Yeah it is in `src` directory)
